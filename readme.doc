TASK 1: The fast forward merge can be performed when there is a direct linear path from the source branch to the target branch. In a fast-forward merge, git simply moves the source branch pointer to the target branch pointer without creating an extra merge commit.

TASK 2b: Merge conflicts often happen when two different branches make updates to the same lines of source code. If you try to merge conflict_branch into develop, Git can't determine which changes to use in the merged version. You might want to keep the changes in the develop branch, the conflict_branch, or some combination of the two. In order to resolve this conflict you must merge commit within the develop branch that reconclices the conflicted changes between the two branches.

TASK 2c: A scenario in which a merge conflict would not occur is if a change made on conflict_branch was not impacting/changing the same lines of code on develop.
